This project is an UI application that allows the user to add/remove list items and then saves the additions and deletions 
in the browser's local storage. I learned a ton about working with the DOM and accessing it's methods/objects, using the ES2015 syntax, 
using helper functions and methods, and saving and deleting items from local storage.

Tools used: vanilla JavaScript, Materialize.css, and Bootstrap's Font Awesome for icons.
